# 🎯✨ Virtual Dart Game: Gesture-Controlled Fun with AI & AR Integration

> *A Hackathon-Ready Innovation* blending Computer Vision, Real-Time WebSockets, and Immersive Unity Gameplay.

## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

Imagine playing darts without touching a single object — just pure gestures and immersive visuals. This project brings a *next-gen gaming experience* by combining:

- 🔍 *AI-Powered Gesture Recognition* (OpenCV + MediaPipe)
- 🌐 *Real-Time WebSocket Communication* (Python ↔ Unity)
- 🎮 *Physics-Based Dart Throwing in Unity*
- 🌈 Optional: *Augmented Reality Mode (AR Foundation Ready)*

✅ Built for scalability, accessibility, and fun — perfect for education, physiotherapy, AR gaming zones, and remote multiplayer!
